**Body:**  
Hi Maria,

I’m reaching out regarding the Riverside Mill site you mentioned at the Dublin property forum last month. We’ve been looking for a mixed-use opportunity of that scale and I’d like to understand the vendor’s expectations before we dive in.

Could you forward the information memorandum and any recent planning correspondence?

Best,  
John

Hi John,

Good to hear from you. I’ve attached the IM and the latest planning officer’s report. Guide price is €27 m but the vendor is open to sensible structures given the remediation works required.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Kind regards,  
Maria

Hi Maria,

Thanks for the pack. Could you arrange access for our architect and environmental consultant next week? They’ll need a full day on site.

Also, our legal team (copied) would like the draft title pack and any historic contamination surveys.

The caretaker will meet your team at 09:00 on Thursday 2 Feb. I’ve dropped the title documents and the 2016 Phase 1 contamination report into a shared folder for your solicitors.

See you on site.

**Body:**  
Hi Maria,

The mill structure is sounder than expected; however, asbestos is present in the north wing roof panels. That will add circa €450 k to strip and dispose.

We’re running numbers and should revert with an indicative offer shortly.

Cheers,  
John

Thanks, John.

The vendor anticipated some asbestos cost and is willing to discuss a price chip if supported by quotes. Send through your estimate and we’ll take it from there.

The vendor counters at €25.1 m but will share 50 % of asbestos removal above €300 k (cap €600 k). They also request a 9-month long-stop.

Let me know whether that works.

We can stretch to €24.8 m and accept the 9-month long-stop provided the cost-share kicks in at €200 k (still capped at €600 k). See amended HoTs attached.

Please find our mark-ups on clauses 6 (warranties) and 9 (escrow release). Key point: we require a 24-month defect liability period given the unknowns in the foundations.

Let’s discuss tomorrow if you have time.

Noted. Vendor will agree to an 18-month liability period but insists on a €2 m cap. Can your side accept that compromise?

We can meet at 18 months if the cap is €2.5 m rather than €2 m. That bridges the gap in risk allocation.
